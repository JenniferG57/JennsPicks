                 and he decides that they need to be more conservative with their money so he decides to quite smoking. He finds himself unable 
                 to quit the way most users do and soon finds himself at his doctors looking for a way to help himself. While there an... incident occurs with his doctor.
            He ends up seeing another doctor while he was there who refers him to an expirimental medical trail ment to stop his cravings, desperate and with a child on the way he accepts but the 
        pills begin to make him... different<br><br></h5><h6>My Opinion:7/10 <br>It was well written and the story was genuinly intriguing, the ending was good and leaves a reader wondering and thinking 
			about their life. I would reccomend the audio version as the voice actor is incredibly talented although the audio is almost 50 minutes long, I reccomend playing it while doing other
			 work</h6> <h6><a class="link" href="https://exitcreep.wordpress.com/2011/01/12/quitting">Written Version</a><br>

   <br><br><h3>"Has Anyone Heard of the Left Right Game"</h3><h5>The story begins from the point of view of a student who went to the same school
as a women named Alice Sharma, the real protagonist of the story. The story is told through tapes of her journey as she delves into the paranormal and ends
up joining a man in playing a game called "The Left Right Game", she ends up in over her head on her journey and their
party of 7 groups begins to slowly dwindle down.</h5><h6>My Opinion:7.5/10 <br>This story was quite long but in my opinion it was worth it. While reading there are 10 parts and the audio for it is was 6 hours long.
The voice actor for this story was incredibly talented and made the story immersive. The characters are realtable and you end up connecting to them which later on just brings you pain but its worth it. </h6>

<br><br><h3>"They paid me $5000 to go through hell</h3><h5>This story is about a man who sees an advertisement that says “Revolutionize science! Earn $5000! Call us now!” and decides to give them a call <br>
The man doesn't have a lot of money so this offer seems too good to be true when he finds it<br>
		The laboratory has a strong vetting process but eventually they accept him and begin to explain the experiment<br>
		They tell him that they will be putting him in a sensory deprivation tank that they have created but they will be taking away all his senses to the extremes and that he will be in this chamber for 3 days<br>
		All of his vitals will be monitered, he wont have sight, he will be paralyzed so he will not feel anything, all his bodily functions will be taken care of by the machines, and in the beginning the scientist will speak to him to check in on him but eventually the sound will be cut off as well<br>
		The man decides to agree to the expiriment and signs all the waivers the company gives him, now its important to know that one of the reasons they chose him is beacuse he was a nobody, he had no family, no friends, and no one to come looking for him.<br>
		</h5><h6>My Opinion:8/10 This story made me question alot of things about my life and the world I experiance. It is very physcologically stimulating and impactful. The story shows his ideas in thoughts during a time where
			he wasnt able to feel himself or anything around him. He experianced a state of nothingness which sent him spiraling within the machine and the story goes into his mental state throughout his 3 days. The voice actor for the audio version isn't one of my favorites but its worth it for the story.
