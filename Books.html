            After serving out a year of hard labor in the salt mines of Endovier for her crimes, 18-year-old assassin Celaena 
            Sardothien is dragged before the Crown Prince. Prince Dorian offers her her freedom on one condition: she must act
             as his champion in a competition to find a new royal assassin. Her opponents are men -- thieves and assassins and
              warriors from across the empire, each sponsored by a member of the king's council. If she beats her opponents in a 
              series of eliminations, she'll serve the kingdom for three years and then be granted her freedom. Celaena finds her 
              training sessions with the captain of the guard, Westfall, challenging and exhilarating. But she's bored stiff by court life. 
              Things get a little more interesting when the prince starts to show interest in her... but it's the gruff Captain Westfall who 
              seems to understand her best. Then one of the other contestants turns up dead... quickly followed by another. Can Celaena figure out who 
            the killer is before she becomes a victim? As the young assassin investigates, her search leads her to discover a 
            greater destiny than she could possibly have imagined.<br><br>My Opinion: The book had interesting characters and a good story line that could keep you intrigued bu the Author
		established weird romantic relationships/possibilities with characters that ended up not being the main love intrests and just muddled parts of the story with it.Eventhough, it is still one of my favorite series <br>

			greater destiny than she could possibly have imagined.<br><br>My Opinion: 8/10 I really enjoyed the characters within this book because they weren't good people. They weren't good characters that did good things, they were bad
		people who came together to commit a crime. Wether they were actually good or bad really depends on how a reader interperts the characters. </h5>

	<h3>Charlatans<br> By:Robin Cook<h3> <h5>5.5/10<br> Genre: Thriller, Suspense, Medical thriller, Medical fiction<br><br>
		Noah Rothauser is the new super chief resident at Boston Memorial Hospital. Housing state-of-the-art medical facilities, it’s always been Noah’s dream to
		 work for such an esteemed institution. 
		But the pressures of the role become all too clear when a seemingly routine operation results in the tragic death of an otherwise healthy man. With potential 
		malpractice suspected it falls to the newly appointed surgical doctor to investigate what happened.<br>

Questioning those involved uncovers bitter feuds within the hospital’s surgical staff when Dr. William Mason, the egotistical, world-class surgeon who performed the operation, is 
quick to blame staff anaeshtetist Dr. Ava London for the disastrous outcome. However Dr. London, along with the nursing staff, point the finger at the surgeon.<br>

When two more anaesthesia-related deaths occur, Noah is forced to look closer at the impressively competent, charming, yet mysterious Dr. London, and he quickly realizes 
there’s far more to her than meets the eye. With his own job and integrity coming into jeopardy, Noah must decide which doctor is at fault and who he can believe – before any more
 lives are lost<br><br>My Opinion: 5.5/10 The story involves the medical field and that was the first thing that drew me to the story. The characters weren't too interesting but the murders and how it all came together were fair in their own way
and there aren't many complaints about the actual mystery of the story. The characters were the main issue as they just seemed lackluster and without depth</h5>
