            <div class="column middle solid"><h3>Solo-Leveling</h3> 8/10 <br>Genre:Action, Adventure, Fantasy<br><br>10 years ago, after 
                “the Gate” that connected the real world with the monster world opened, some of the ordinary, 
                everyday people received the power to hunt monsters within the Gate. They are known as "Hunters". 
                However, not all Hunters are powerful. My name is Sung Jin-Woo, an E-rank Hunter. This is the story of Sung Jin-Woo
                and his journey to become the world strongest S-Rank Hunter.<br><br> My Opinion: The art is incredible, especially during fighting scenes. 
                The story has good progression within the story line and theres always another antagonist waiting to follow up the last one which calls for entertaining fight scenes.
                I would mostly reccomend this to someone whos geniunly intrested in action stories as it is a long manhwa.
				I'm someone who has to risk his life in the lowliest of dungeons, the "World's Weakest". <img src="http://i4.mangapicgallery.com/r/coverlink/rROHYYKHa8HlWy3U7kHm8eI5JAZfMXoAoQ8fjgRcwmDVE6-.jpg?1&4" alt="Solo-Leveling" width="50%" height="600">
				<h3>The Great Mage Returns After 4000 Years</h3> 9/10 <br>Genre:Action, Adventure, Fantasy, Manhua, Shounen<br><br>A poor student in the West Road Academy, the shame of the Blake 
				family chooses to die after living a painful existence. However, a new soul suddenly takes over the body of the student.The new soul can finally take revenge and give power to the name 
				Frey Blake.<br><br> My Opinion: 9/10, this manhwa has everything Iv looked for in a reincarnation story. The story involves the soul of the greatest mage in history who has been in prisioned by a being 
				reffered to as Demi-G-d in purgatory and after 4000 years he is able to come back to the world in the body of Frey Blake. The reason I rated this so highly and it is one of my favorite manhwas is because it
				involved features that most reincarnation stories lack. In most stories, after a soul is reincarnated they begin to ignore the past life of the original soul but instead both the past of Frey Blake and the new soul are 
				put into the story and make the actions of the character more impactful. I really enjoyed the comedy and the personality of the main character, it made the story incredibly enjoyable.<br>

				 <h3>Unemployed Concentration Camp</h3> 5/10 <br>Genre:Seinen, Action, Horror, Mystery, Physcological<br><br>2022, Japans non-laborers recovery strategy has been built up. An individual who does not have salary for
				  over a half year, is liable to a treatment where they rework their cerebrum at a recovery treatment office. Tatsuya Kamijo was working in an outside possessed speculation organization. One day he loses his employment, however a half year later, Tatsuya is sent to an inhumane 
				 imprisonment instead of a playback office. There he is exposed to more regrettable treatment than mentally programming and preparing. For what reason was Tatsuya sent there?<br><br> My Opinion:5/10, the story is intereseting from a Physcological point of
				 view as it takes a look at what would happen in an extremely capitalist society that derives human value from the labor they apply. It shows a horrible reality that in its own way doesn't seem like an impossiblity. I didn't rate it higher as the chapters have slight pacing problems
				 and many readers found the ending confusing. The concept itself was interesting and it was written by the same author as Solo-Leveling<br>
