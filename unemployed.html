                  <hr>
                  <p><b>Manhwa</b><br> Unemployed Concentration Camp
                  <br><b>Creator</b><br> Kamakura Atsushi<br> <b>Rating:<br></b>5/10<br><b>Genre:</b><br>Seinen, Action, Horror, Mystery, Physcological<br><b>Description:<br></b>2022, Japans non-laborers recovery strategy has been built up. An individual who does not have salary for
				  over a half year, is liable to a treatment where they rework their cerebrum at a recovery treatment office. Tatsuya Kamijo was working in an outside possessed speculation organization. One day he loses his employment, however a half year later, Tatsuya is sent to an inhumane 
				 imprisonment instead of a playback office. There he is exposed to more regrettable treatment than mentally programming and preparing. For what reason was Tatsuya sent there? <br><b>My Opinion:</b><br>5/10, the story is intereseting from a Physcological point of
				 view as it takes a look at what would happen in an extremely capitalist society that derives human value from the labor they apply. It shows a horrible reality that in its own way doesn't seem like an impossiblity. I didn't rate it higher as the chapters have slight pacing problems
				 and many readers found the ending confusing. The concept itself was interesting and it was written by the same author as Solo-Leveling<br>
