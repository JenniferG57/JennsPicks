                  <hr>
                  <p><b>Anime</b><br> Haikyu
                  <br><b>Creator</b><br> Shō Futamata <br> <b>Rating</b><br>8/10<br><b>Genre:</b><br>Comedy, Drama, School, Shounen, Sports<br><b>Description:</b><br>bInspired after watching a volleyball ace nicknamed "Little Giant" in action, small-statured Shouyou Hinata revives the 
                  volleyball club at his middle school. The newly-formed team even makes it to a tournament; however, their first match turns out to be their last when they are brutally squashed by the "King of the Court," 
                  Tobio Kageyama. Hinata vows to surpass Kageyama, and so after graduating from middle school, he joins Karasuno High School's volleyball team—only to find that his sworn rival, Kageyama, is now his teammate.
                   Thanks to his short height, Hinata struggles to find his role on the team, even with his superior jumping power. Surprisingly, Kageyama has his own problems that only Hinata can help with, and learning to work
                    together appears to be the only way for the team to be successful. Based on Haruichi Furudate's popular shounen manga of the same name, Haikyuu!! is an exhilarating and emotional sports
                   comedy following two determined athletes as they attempt to patch a heated rivalry in order to make their high school volleyball team the best in Japan.<br><b> My Opinion: </b><br>8/10, alot of people might not like sports
                   animes and if they dont then this is definitely not the show for them. I really like the characters within the show and the animation is fantastic. Throughout the anime you can really see
                   the development of the characters and how they begin to change as people because they are now around people who support and encourage them to be better people and players.
