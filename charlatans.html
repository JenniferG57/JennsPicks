                  <p><b>Book</b><br> Charlatans
                  <br><b>Creator</b><br> Robin Cook<br> <b>Rating:<br></b>5.5/10<br><b>Genre:</b><br>Thriller, Suspense, Medical thriller, Medical fiction<br><b>Description:<br></b>
                  Noah Rothauser is the new super chief resident at Boston Memorial Hospital. Housing state-of-the-art medical facilities, it’s always been Noah’s dream to
                   work for such an esteemed institution. 
                  But the pressures of the role become all too clear when a seemingly routine operation results in the tragic death of an otherwise healthy man. With potential 
                  malpractice suspected it falls to the newly appointed surgical doctor to investigate what happened.<br>
          
          Questioning those involved uncovers bitter feuds within the hospital’s surgical staff when Dr. William Mason, the egotistical, world-class surgeon who performed the operation, is 
          quick to blame staff anaeshtetist Dr. Ava London for the disastrous outcome. However Dr. London, along with the nursing staff, point the finger at the surgeon.<br>
          
          When two more anaesthesia-related deaths occur, Noah is forced to look closer at the impressively competent, charming, yet mysterious Dr. London, and he quickly realizes 
          there’s far more to her than meets the eye. With his own job and integrity coming into jeopardy, Noah must decide which doctor is at fault and who he can believe – before any more
           lives are lost<br><b>My Opinion:</b><br>5.5/10 The story involves the medical field and that was the first thing that drew me to the story. The characters weren't too interesting but the murders and how it all came together were fair in their own way
           and there aren't many complaints about the actual mystery of the story. The characters were the main issue as they just seemed lackluster and without depth
