                  <hr>
                  <p><b>Anime</b><br> Zankyou No Terror/Terror in Resonance
                  <br><b>Creator</b><br> Shinichirō Watanabe<br> <b>Rating:<br></b>7.5/10<br><b>Genre:</b><br>Mystery, Physcological, Thriller<br><b>Description:</b>Painted in red, the word "VON" is all that is left behind after a terrorist attack on a nuclear 
                  facility in Japan. The government is shattered by their inability to act, and the police are left frantically searching for ways to crack down the perpetrators. The public are clueless—until, 
                  six months later, a strange video makes its way onto the internet. In it, two teenage boys who identify themselves only as "Sphinx" directly challenge the police, threatening to cause destruction 
                  and mayhem across Tokyo. Unable to stop the mass panic quickly spreading through the city and desperate for any leads in their investigation, the police struggle to act effectively against these terrorists, 
                  with Detective Kenjirou Shibazaki caught in the middle of it all.Zankyou no Terror tells the story of Nine and Twelve, the two boys behind the masked figures of Sphinx. They should not exist, 
                  yet they stand strong in a world of deception and secrets while they make the city fall around them, all in the hopes of burying their own tragic truth<br><b> My Opinion:</b><br> A 7.5/10 I really enjoyed the development of the characters
                  and there relationship and trust with in eachother. The main characters of this story have a disturbing past which has led them to there actions in Tokyo. Theres a third character brought in and she stands
                  in place of us the audience and she is used as the tool to convey the past of the characters and their message. The story was really intirguing and it is one of my favorite animes.
