            <div class="column middle solid"><h3>Nanbaka</h3>9/10<br><br>Genre:Action, Comedy, Drama<br><br>The story centers around four young men who are assigned to Nanba, the world's most formidable prison. Jyugo, who attempted to break out of prison and ended up extending his jail time; Uno, a gambling fanatic who likes women; Rock, 
                who likes eating and fighting; and Nico, an ex drug addict who happens to be an otaku.<br><br> My Opinion: A 9/10 might seem too high but I would definitely
            consider it one of my favorite animes as it had a great story and good comedy as well as action.<br>

			<h3>Zankyou No Terror</h3>7.5/10<br><br>Genre:Mystery, Physcological, Thriller<br><br>Painted in red, the word "VON" is all that is left behind after a terrorist attack on a nuclear 
			facility in Japan. The government is shattered by their inability to act, and the police are left frantically searching for ways to crack down the perpetrators. The public are clueless—until, 
			six months later, a strange video makes its way onto the internet. In it, two teenage boys who identify themselves only as "Sphinx" directly challenge the police, threatening to cause destruction 
			and mayhem across Tokyo. Unable to stop the mass panic quickly spreading through the city and desperate for any leads in their investigation, the police struggle to act effectively against these terrorists, 
			with Detective Kenjirou Shibazaki caught in the middle of it all.Zankyou no Terror tells the story of Nine and Twelve, the two boys behind the masked figures of Sphinx. They should not exist, 
			yet they stand strong in a world of deception and secrets while they make the city fall around them, all in the hopes of burying their own tragic truth<br><br> My Opinion: A 7.5/10 I really enjoyed the development of the characters
			and there relationship and trust with in eachother. The main characters of this story have a disturbing past which has led them to there actions in Tokyo. Theres a third character brought in and she stands
			in place of us the audience and she is used as the tool to convey the past of the characters and their message. The story was really intirguing and it is one of my favorite animes.

		<h3>Haikyu!!</h3>8/10<br><br>Genre:Comedy, Drama, School, Shounen, Sports<br><br>Inspired after watching a volleyball ace nicknamed "Little Giant" in action, small-statured Shouyou Hinata revives the 
		volleyball club at his middle school. The newly-formed team even makes it to a tournament; however, their first match turns out to be their last when they are brutally squashed by the "King of the Court," 
		Tobio Kageyama. Hinata vows to surpass Kageyama, and so after graduating from middle school, he joins Karasuno High School's volleyball team—only to find that his sworn rival, Kageyama, is now his teammate.
		 Thanks to his short height, Hinata struggles to find his role on the team, even with his superior jumping power. Surprisingly, Kageyama has his own problems that only Hinata can help with, and learning to work
		  together appears to be the only way for the team to be successful. Based on Haruichi Furudate's popular shounen manga of the same name, Haikyuu!! is an exhilarating and emotional sports
		 comedy following two determined athletes as they attempt to patch a heated rivalry in order to make their high school volleyball team the best in Japan.<br><br> My Opinion: 8/10, alot of people might not like sports
		 animes and if they dont then this is definitely not the show for them. I really like the characters within the show and the animation is fantastic. Throughout the anime you can really see
		 the development of the characters and how they begin to change as people because they are now around people who support and encourage them to be better people and players.
