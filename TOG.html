                  <p><b>Book</b><br> Throne Of Glass
                  <br><b>Creator</b><br> Sarah J. Maas<br> <b>Rating:<br></b>7.5/10<br><b>Genre:</b><br>Fantasy Fiction<br><b>Description:<br></b>After serving out a year of hard labor in the salt mines of Endovier for her crimes, 18-year-old assassin Celaena 
                  Sardothien is dragged before the Crown Prince. Prince Dorian offers her her freedom on one condition: she must act
                   as his champion in a competition to find a new royal assassin. Her opponents are men -- thieves and assassins and
                    warriors from across the empire, each sponsored by a member of the king's council. If she beats her opponents in a 
                    series of eliminations, she'll serve the kingdom for three years and then be granted her freedom. Celaena finds her 
                    training sessions with the captain of the guard, Westfall, challenging and exhilarating. But she's bored stiff by court life. 
                    Things get a little more interesting when the prince starts to show interest in her... but it's the gruff Captain Westfall who 
                    seems to understand her best. Then one of the other contestants turns up dead... quickly followed by another. Can Celaena figure out who 
                  the killer is before she becomes a victim? As the young assassin investigates, her search leads her to discover a 
                  greater destiny than she could possibly have imagined.<br><b>My Opinion:</b><br>The book had interesting characters and a good story line that could keep you intrigued bu the Author
                  established weird romantic relationships/possibilities with characters that ended up not being the main love intrests and just muddled parts of the story with it. Eventhough I have issues with parts, it is still one of my favorite series <br>
