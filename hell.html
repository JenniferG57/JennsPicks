                  <p class="padding-left"><b>Horror Story</b><br> "They paid me $5000 to go through hell"
                  <br><b>Creator</b><br> Jaksim<br> <b>Rating</b><br>8/10<br><b>Description:<br></b>This story is about a man who sees an advertisement that says “Revolutionize science! Earn $5000! Call us now!” and decides to give them a call <br>
                  The man doesn't have a lot of money so this offer seems too good to be true when he finds it<br>
                          The laboratory has a strong vetting process but eventually they accept him and begin to explain the experiment<br>
                          They tell him that they will be putting him in a sensory deprivation tank that they have created but they will be taking away all his senses to the extremes and that he will be in this chamber for 3 days<br>
                          All of his vitals will be monitered, he wont have sight, he will be paralyzed so he will not feel anything, all his bodily functions will be taken care of by the machines, and in the beginning the scientist will speak to him to check in on him but eventually the sound will be cut off as well<br>
                          The man decides to agree to the expiriment and signs all the waivers the company gives him, now its important to know that one of the reasons they chose him is beacuse he was a nobody, he had no family, no friends, and no one to come looking for him.<br>
                          <br> <b>My Opinion:</b> <br>My Opinion:8/10 This story made me question alot of things about my life and the world I experiance. It is very physcologically stimulating and impactful. The story shows his ideas in thoughts during a time where
                          he wasnt able to feel himself or anything around him. He experianced a state of nothingness which sent him spiraling within the machine and the story goes into his mental state throughout his 3 days. The voice actor for the audio version isn't one of my favorites but its worth it for the story.
